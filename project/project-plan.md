# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Impact of Climate change on various species of  trees in Frankfurt

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How average monthly temperature impacts the crown diameter of various species of trees?
2. How it effects the different ages of plants ( we will calculate this on basis of plantation year)
